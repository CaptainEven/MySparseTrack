## Abstract
Exploring robust and efficient association methods has always been an important issue in multiple-object tracking (MOT).
Although existing tracking methods have achieved impressive performance, congestion and frequent occlusions still pose challenging problems in multi-object tracking. We reveal that performing sparse decomposition on dense scenes is a crucial step to enhance the performance of associating occluded targets. To this end, we propose a pseudo-depth estimation method for obtaining the relative depth of targets from 2D images. Secondly, we design a depth cascading matching (DCM) algorithm, which can use the obtained depth information to convert a dense target set into multiple sparse target subsets and perform data association on these sparse target subsets in order from near to far. By integrating the pseudo-depth method and the DCM strategy into the data association process, we propose a new tracker, called SparseTrack. SparseTrack provides a new perspective for solving the challenging crowded scene MOT problem and achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the MOT17 and MOT20 test set.

## Tracking performance
### Results on MOT challenge test set
| Dataset    | HOTA | MOTA | IDF1 | MT | ML | FP | FN | IDs |
|------------|-------|-------|------|------|-------|-------|------|------|
|MOT17       | 65.1 | 81.0 | 80.1 | 54.6% | 14.3% | 23904 | 81927 | 1170 |
|MOT20       | 63.4 | 78.2 | 77.3 | 69.9% | 9.2%  | 25108 | 86720 | 1116 |

 ### Comparison on DanceTrack test set
|  Method  | HOTA | DetA | AssA | MOTA | IDF1 |
|------------|-------|-------|------|------|-------|
| SparseTrack | 55.5 (**+7.8**) | 78.9 (**+7.9**) | 39.1 (**+7.0**) | 91.3 (**+1.7**) | 58.3 (**+4.4**) |
| ByteTrack  |  47.7 | 71.0 | 32.1 | 89.6 | 53.9 | 
    
**Notes**: 
- All the inference experiments are performed on 1 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPUs. 
- Each experiment uses the same detector and model weights as [ByteTrack](https://github.com/ifzhang/ByteTrack) . 
- SparseTrack relies on IoU distance association only and do not use any appearance embedding, learnable motion, and attention components.
 
## Installation
#### Dependence

#### Install
```shell
git clone https://github.com/hustvl/SparseTrack.git
cd SparseTrack
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install Cython  
pip install cython_bbox
```

## Data preparation
Download [MOT17](https://motchallenge.net/), [MOT20](https://motchallenge.net/), [CrowdHuman](https://www.crowdhuman.org/), [Cityperson](https://github.com/Zhongdao/Towards-Realtime-MOT/blob/master/DATASET_ZOO.md), [ETHZ](https://github.com/Zhongdao/Towards-Realtime-MOT/blob/master/DATASET_ZOO.md) and put them under ROOT/ in the following structure:
```
ROOT
   |
   |â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”SparseTrack(repo)
   |
   |â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”MOT17
   |        â””â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”train
   |        â””â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”test
   â””â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”crowdhuman
   |         â””â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”Crowdhuman_train
   |         â””â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”Crowdhuman_val
   |         â””â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”annotation_train.odgt

   |        â””â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”test
   â””â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”Citypersons
   |        â””â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”images
   |        â””â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”labels_with_ids
   â””â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”ETHZ
            â””â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”eth01
            â””â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”...
            â””â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”eth07
```
Then, you need to turn the datasets to COCO format and mix different training data:
```
cd <ROOT>/SparseTrack
python3 tools/convert_mot17_to_coco.py
python3 tools/convert_mot20_to_coco.py
python3 tools/convert_crowdhuman_to_coco.py
python3 tools/convert_cityperson_to_coco.py
python3 tools/convert_ethz_to_coco.py
```
Creating different training mix_data:
```
cd <ROOT>/SparseTrack

# training on CrowdHuman and MOT17 half train, evaluate on MOT17 half val.
python3 tools/mix_data_ablation.py

# training on CrowdHuman and MOT20 half train, evaluate on MOT20 half val.
python3 tools/mix_data_ablation_20.py

# training on MOT17, CrowdHuman, ETHZ, Citypersons, evaluate on MOT17 train.
python3 tools/mix_data_test_mot17.py

# training on MOT20 and CrowdHuman, evaluate on MOT20 train.
python3 tools/mix_data_test_mot20.py
```

## Model zoo
See [ByteTrack.model_zoo](https://github.com/ifzhang/ByteTrack#model-zoo). All tracking results are obtained via the corresponding YOLOX_X model weights for inference.

Additionally, we conducted joint training on MOT20 train half and Crowdhuman, and evaluated on MOT20 val half. The model as follows: [yolox_x_mot20_ablation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F2XwyYKj1kefLPUFRHxgnpaAmEwyoocw/view?usp=drive_link)

The model trained on DanceTrack can be available at [yolox_x_dancetrack](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-uxcNTi7dhuDNGC5MmzXyllLzmVbzXay?usp=sharing).
