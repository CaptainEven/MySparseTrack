## Abstract
####  SparseTrack is a simply and strong multi-object tracker. 
 
 <p align="center"><img src="DCM.png" width="500"/></p>

Exploring robust and efficient association methods has always been an important issue in multiple-object tracking (MOT).
Although existing tracking methods have achieved impressive performance, congestion and frequent occlusions still pose challenging problems in multi-object tracking. 
We reveal that performing sparse decomposition on dense scenes is a crucial step to enhance the performance of associating occluded targets. 
To this end, we propose a pseudo-depth estimation method for obtaining the relative depth of targets from 2D images.  
Secondly, we design a depth cascading matching (DCM) algorithm, which can use the obtained depth information to convert a dense target set into multiple sparse target subsets and perform data association on these sparse target subsets in order from near to far. 
By integrating the pseudo-depth method and the DCM strategy into the data association process, we propose a new tracker, called SparseTrack. 
SparseTrack provides a new perspective for solving the challenging crowded scene MOT problem and achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the MOT17 and MOT20 test set.

## Tracking performance
### Results on MOT challenge test set
| Dataset    | HOTA | MOTA | IDF1 | MT | ML | FP | FN | IDs |
|------------|-------|-------|------|------|-------|-------|------|------|
|MOT17       | 65.1 | 81.0 | 80.1 | 54.6% | 14.3% | 23904 | 81927 | 1170 |
|MOT20       | 63.4 | 78.2 | 77.3 | 69.9% | 9.2%  | 25108 | 86720 | 1116 |

**Notes**: 
- All the experiments are performed on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPUs. 
- All implementations use the same detector and model weights as [ByteTrack](https://github.com/ifzhang/ByteTrack) .
